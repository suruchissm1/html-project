            India has some of the world's most biodiverse regions. The political boundaries of India encompass a wide range of biomes–desert, high mountains, highlands, tropical and temperate forests, swamplands, plains, grasslands, areas surrounding
            rivers, as well as island archipelago. It hosts 4 biodiversity hotspots: the Himalayas, the Western Ghats, the Indo-Burma region and the Sundaland (Includes group of Islands).These hotspots have numerous endemic species. <a

        The flora of India is one of the richest in the world due to the wide range of climate, topology and habitat in the country. There are estimated to be over 18,000 species of flowering plants in India, which constitute some 6-7 percent of the
        total plant species in the world. India is home to more than 50,000 species of plants, including a variety of endemics. The use of plants as a source of medicines has been an integral part of life in India from the earliest times. There are
        more than 3000 Indian plant species officially documented as possessing into eight main floristic regions : Western Himalayas, Eastern Himalayas, Assam, Indus plain, Ganges plain, the Deccan, Malabar and the Andaman Islands. <a

        The diversity of fungi and their natural beauty occupy a prime place in the biological world and India has been a cradle for such organisms. Only a fraction of the total fungal wealth of India has been subjected to scientific scrutiny and
        mycologists have to unravel this unexplored and hidden wealth. One-third of the fungal diversity of the globe exists in India. The country has an array of 10 diverse biomes including Trans-Himalayan zone, Himalaya, Desert, Semi-Arid zone,
        Western Ghats, Deccan Peninsula, Gangetic Plain, North-Eastern India, Coasts and Islands where varied dominating regimes manifest. This enables the survival of manifold fungal flora in these regions which include hot spot areas like the
        Himalayan ranges, Western Ghats, hill stations, mangroves, sea coasts, freshwater bodies etc.The number of fungi recorded in India exceeds 27,000 species, the largest biotic community after insects. The true fungi belong to the Kingdom[18]
        Fungi which has four phyla, 103 orders, 484 families and 4979 genera. <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_of_India"><em>More</em></a>

        Article 48 of the Constitution of India says, "The state shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country" and Article 51-A states that "it shall be the duty of every citizen of
        India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures".The committee in the Indian Board for Wildlife, in their report, defines wildlife as "the entire
        natural uncultivated flora and fauna of the country" while the Wildlife (protection) Act 1972 defines it as "any animal, bees, butterflies, crustacea, fish, moths and aquatic or land vegetation which forms part of any habitat. <a

        Some bird species have gone extinct in recent times, including the pink-headed duck (Rhodonessa caryophyllacea) and the Himalayan quail (Ophrysia superciliosa). A species of warbler, Acrocephalus orinus, known earlier from a single
        species.Some of the wild species are on the brink of extinction and some of them are already extinction such as Dangs Giant Squirrel and Aldabra banded snail. Critically endangered species in India are the Great cats,one Horne
        rhinoceros,Ganges river dolphins,Purple frog,birds species such as Himalayan Quail,Great Indian Bustard and Indian Horn-bill and many small mammals. <a

        The varied and rich wildlife of India has had a profound impact on the region's popular culture. India's wildlife has been the subject of numerous tales and fables such as the Panchatantra or the Jataka Tales.Notions of the wildlife of India
        were introduced in the west and also been made famous through The Jungle Book in late 1800s by Rudyard Kipling.The animal kingdom is not separate to the human realm in Indian culture and mythology. Both Hindu and Buddhist beliefs situate
        humans, animals, and birds on the same plane of existence, sharing cycles of reincarnation. In India, sacred animals are highly visible in everyday life as they are venerated.<a
